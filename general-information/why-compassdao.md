# Why CompassDAO?

The crypto world runs for several years, but the **info barrier** still exists, especially in some new areas, e.g. DeFi, NFT, GameFi, or other Web3.0 projects. It’s too hard for new entrants to know what’s happening here and what’s to do, it’s even not so easy for mature crypto players, as the crypto world is developing too fast and the **info explosion** everyday. It’s impossible for individual players to catch up with all the opportunities.&#x20;

We would like to **gather the wisdom and efforts of the crowd** to build an **info aggregation platform**. Here you **contribute** your knowhow, and **get** from the others. We also connect different **skills**, some are good at research, some are good at programming or security, people can **cooperate to get the largest benefit** in our DAO.
