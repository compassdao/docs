# Why compassDAO?

The cryptocurrency world has been around for several years, but there is still a significant information barrier, particularly in new areas such as DeFi, NFT, GameFi, or other Web3.0 projects. It is challenging for new entrants to understand what is happening and what to do. Even mature cryptocurrency players face difficulties keeping up with the rapidly developing industry and the daily explosion of new information. It is impossible for individual players to keep up with all the opportunities.



compassDAO aims to solve this problem by **gathering the wisdom and efforts of the crowd** to build the powerful **info aggregation platform**. Users can contribute their knowledge and learn from others. The platform also connects people with different skills, such as research, programming, or security, allowing them to **collaborate** to get the maximum benefit from the DAO.



CompassDAO provides a valuable resource for people looking to navigate the complex and ever-changing world of cryptocurrency by providing a platform for information sharing, collaboration, and skill development.\
