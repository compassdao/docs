# Value

Value-driven: We focus on the works to bring benefit for our DAO members, help our members find the most-value protocols.

Transparency: Project code is fully open-source, roadmap, and future finance allocation will all be disclosed to DAO members.

Decentralize: We value all the ideas and contribution from members, and we put decision making into the hands of DAO.

Culture: We encourage sharing, people contribute either mind-sights or works, communicate and benefit from it.
