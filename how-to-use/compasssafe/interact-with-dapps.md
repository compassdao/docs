# Interact With Dapps

When all the configuration is done, you can now use the app to interact with any Dapps (DeFi, NFT, Web3 projects, etc.)

Note: If it's the first time for your member to use the app, he/she needs to bind the Safe&#x20;

_**1.Go to the Dapp you want to use, here we take Etherscan as a sample. Click on "Connect Wallet", select "WalletConnect".**_

_**4.Now the app is connected, you can initiate any transaction in Dapps (e.g. Etherscan), and you'll get the request here.**_

Note: If the current member(connected metamask wallet) does not have the corresponding permission, the transaction will be failed.

_**6.Later you can find the transactions you signed with our app in "TRANSACTION" tab, click on "View" to see the parsed details of the transaction.**_
