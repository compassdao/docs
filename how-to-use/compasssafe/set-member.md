# Set Member

You can set any address(even if a member who's not the owner of the Safe) as a member and grant it with customized roles. &#x20;

_**1.Go to "MEMBERS", click on "ADD MEMBER", enter the Member Name(stored locally, can be modified), the address of the member, and the roles you want to grant to it.**_

_**2.Sign the transaction with the Safe owners.**_

Now the member is granted with the roles, so he/she can initiate and sign the pre-defined transactions.

_**3.You may edit/delete the members anytime you want (you'll need to sign a transaction with Safe owners when you do it).**_
