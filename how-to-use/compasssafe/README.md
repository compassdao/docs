# compassSafe

compassSafe is a RBAC (role based access control) protocol based on [Safe](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/3876456-what-is-gnosis-safe) (pre.Gnosis Safe). As the most popular smart contract wallet, Safe supports standard multi-signature, and compassSafe builds on Safe [Module](https://help.gnosis-safe.io/en/articles/4934378-what-is-a-module) to provide users with enhanced security and flexibility.



_**For institutions and DAOs (multi-player organizations)**_, compassSafe enables the organization to set permissions to different members, allowing them to perform specific actions based on their roles. e.g. Traders can only swap specified token pairs with specified Dex protocol.&#x20;



_**For individual users**_, compassSafe can be used as a multi-level safe vault, where they can set different levels of permissions for different wallets to isolate the risks with different operations. e.g. a user may set hardware wallets as the owners of the Safe with the core permissions, but grant some daily-use-low-risk permissions with a software wallet.



compassSafe provides fine-grained permission configurations with contracts, methods, and parameter levels, applicable to all types of contracts. This enables the users with a secure and flexible way to manage their digital assets on the blockchain.
