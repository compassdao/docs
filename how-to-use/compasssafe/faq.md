1. _When I'm sining a transaction, I got the error message: <mark style="color:red;">'Tip: There might be an error. Please check if the current member (0x...) has the permission.'</mark>_
2. There's no error message, I sign the transaction in Metamask, but the transaction seems failed and cannot be found in transaction list
