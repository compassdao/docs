# Set Role

You can customize the role based on contract address, functions, or even the parameters of each function. &#x20;

_**1.Go to "ROLES", click on "ADD ROLE", enter the Role Name(which cannot be modified later), and the target Contract Address.**_&#x20;

Then the functions of the contract will be listed automatically (the contract must be open-source). You can check on the functions you want to grant to the role, you can even define the parameters of the functions here.

Then you can find the roles in the list, click on "View" to view the details of the role (associated functions and parameters):

Note: We recommend you to specify the functions for each role, later you can combine them in [Member](set-member.md).
