# Connect Wallet

You can view the community scripts without any authentication, but once you want to try the functions, we recommend you to connect your wallet first.&#x20;

**Notice: we will never ask you for the private key or Mnemonic Phrase!  We connect your wallet just to verify your DID.**

****

Choose the wallet you're using, sign the pop-up message, now you're here!
