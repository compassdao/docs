# Set Alerts

Several Alerts with any conditions can be set after you have a script run as a task (See [Schedule Tasks](schedule-tasks.md))

_**1.Go to "My Space - Tasks "  , click on any item to see a scheduled Task, you will get the latest 30 times results. Click on "+Add New" to add a new Alert here.**_

_**2.Define the condition of the Alert here.**_ If the result of your script is a single value, you can define the condition with the default "value" field directly. &#x20;

You can also enter the key of your wanted value _**if you have the result as "Object"**_.  And you can set flexible alert message with the results.
